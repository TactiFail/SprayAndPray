# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in making this thing less bad!

As has been stated, I am not a developer.  I am a person who can write scripts of modest complexity and stability, so when people want to fix or improve the things I write I am usually pretty happy.  I have a small list of requests for those wishing to contribute:

* Please fix/add only one thing at a time
* Reference a specific Issue if one exists
* Update versions according to https://semver.org/
